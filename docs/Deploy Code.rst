Pair Joystick and Cortex
========================

  The Joystick must first be paired to the Cortex Microcontroller before they will work using the VEXnet Keys. Pairing requires a USB A-A Cable and a VEX 7.2V Battery. This process must be completed each time you use a Joystick or Cortex with a new mate. A Joystick can only communicate with a Cortex that it has been paired with. During the Pairing Process, the ID from the Cortex is transferred to the Joystick; thus mating the two units together.

- Start with the Cortex and Joystick turned OFF.

- Connect the Cortex to the Joystick using a USB A-A Cable.

- Connect the 7.2V Robot Battery to the Cortex.

- Power up only the Cortex.

- A successful tether is indicated by a Solid Green VEXnet LED on both the Joystick and the Cortex

- The Solid Green VEXnet LED must remain ON on both units at the same time for a minimum of 5 seconds.

- Disregard the other LEDs as you are only interested in the VEXnet LED.

- Pairing may take up to one minute to complete.

- Once the units have finished pairing, turn OFF the Cortex.

- Disconnect the USB A-A Cable from both units.

- Disconnect the 7.2V Robot Battery from the Cortex. 

- Connect the USB KEY and trun on  both the Cortex and Joystick to pair them wirelessly.
